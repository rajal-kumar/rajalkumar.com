    "aboutme": "Hey, I'm a FullStack developer who specialises in React and NodeJs. I design, build, operate and depending on the type of set up I can also work on existing web applications. I have always had a passion for technology and the web - I like to bring my automotive conceptual thinking into the world of programming like how both skills require a build, break, fix, and repeat kind of thinking. I love to write code most days of the week, and most weeks of the year. If I'm not working on a client's project I regularly spend time online browsing for new projects and technologies to further expand my programming knowledge and skills. Please feel free to have a look around on my site and get in contact if you have any questions.",
